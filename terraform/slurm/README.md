## Overview

This is a reference design and implementation of an environment template to provision Slurm via Slinky on a Kubernetes cluster.  This reference design is based on Rafay's Environment Manager.

This template will allow the user to select a pre-existing managed cluster to deploy the Slurm Operator and/or the Slurm cluster onto.
