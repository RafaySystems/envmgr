    This application allows you to import arbitrary PDF files and search over them using LLMs. For each file, the text is divided in chunks that are embedded with OpenAI and stored in Qdrant. When you query the system, the most relevant chunks are retrieved and a summary answer is generated using OpenAI embeddings chained to Amazon Bedrock Model.

    The ingestion and retrieval steps are implemented as dataflows are exposed via FastAPI endpoints. The frontend is built with Streamlit and exposes the different functionalities via a simple web UI. Everything is packaged as containers with helm charts.
